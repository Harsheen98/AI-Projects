# Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset 
- This a publically available dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) which is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. 
- the **first notebook** features detailed Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and Data imputation for the dataset.
- the **second notebook** features the application and comparative analysis of many Machine Learning models and their respective performance on the dataset.
- the **third notebook** will feature application of Deep Learning - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) on the dataset.
